Several years ago, there was Trix on http://www.bhelpuri.net/Trixie/ .
But there is no official sites, only a copy of Ver.0.2.3 could be gotton.
I got a trouble after I installed IE11.
I've tried to solve my problem making own Greasemonkey and got it.
I've looking for the way how my Greasemonkey could be applied on IE11.
Then I got Trixie binary and started to rewrite it.

Features:
* almost same as original Trixie
* single exe file
* self COM register
* WPF options dialog
* cross-domain XmlHttpRequest(GM_xmlhttpRequest) is eliminated
* Google DeLinker Greasemonkey script
* .NET 4.5 required
